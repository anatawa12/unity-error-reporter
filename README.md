Error Reporting System for non-destructive avatar modification tools

This was originally a internal module of [AvatarOptimizer] and it's based on part of [modular-avatar].

To expand the world of non-destructive avatar modification tools, I have extract into a stand-alone library.

This library is still in development but API stability is partially guaranteed.
We use `y` as a major release and `z` as a as a minor release in initial development versions in `0.y.z`.

If you have problems or questions this library, please feel free to contact me on [twitter][twitter] or [Misskey (Activity Pub)][misskey]!
